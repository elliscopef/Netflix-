Introduction: 

It is a a simple version of a movie rental/search/recommendation app and I implemented it as the final project for 2014 Fall Objective Oriented Programming class Final Project. It was a semester long project and used to be stored under a private repository. 


Functionality:

A system where users can log in and look at their accounts.

A system that stores information about movies (movie name, actors name and movie keywords), and allows certain types of searches(search by movie title, search by movie keyword, search by actors)

A system where users can determine queues of movies, and order and return them.(user can add movie from queue to their watching list, choose to rent movie when or return movie)

A recommendation system that uses the movie ratings of many or all users to recommand. (user can rate or rerate movie everytime they return a moive)

Process:

First started implementing the most fundamental data structure : Map & List using Linked List. (For practicing linked list, map & list. In reality actually it's no implemented in Linked List) (Didn't utilize Standard Library);

Then I implemented iterators, merge sort, queue etc fundamental components for practice purpose.At the same time, I started the User class, movie queue and functions for app functionality.

Finally I worked on the UI part of the project, which was implemented using Qt. It relates slots, widgets, event etc. 

Last but not least, I overwrote the first layer of the project- replaced Map & List implementation with Hash Table, which is a more efficient way of programming. This last part gave me more understanding of Object Oriented Programming.



Placement:
A data/movie.txt stores all the movie title, actor, keywords etc. 
B data/user.txt stores all the existing user info, movie under the user and etc. New user can be added using the create new account button in the app.
